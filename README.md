# FactoryIO-Weight-Sorter
A conveyor belt that sorts boxes based on their weight simulated in FactoryIO.

The PLC Folder can be uploaded into OpenPLC Editor or any other PLC Code Editor in order to view the Ladder Diagram/Ladder Logic.

The "weightsorter.st" file in the PLC Folder can be uploaded into the OpenPLC Runtime or any other PLC software to program the logic for the conveyor belt.

To simulate the conveyor belt, we will be using Factory IO, the scene will be saved as "FYP.factoryio". You can paste/move this file into Factory IO by moving it into your scenes folder under Factory IO > My Scenes.
